# CLAUDE.md

This file aligns development of the **Zvuk Music** provider with the
upstream [`music-assistant/server`](https://github.com/music-assistant/server)
standards. It is rendered from `wrappers/CLAUDE.md.j2` in
[`trudenboy/ma-provider-tools`](https://github.com/trudenboy/ma-provider-tools)
and is kept in sync across every provider repo — **do not edit it here**.

Provider-specific architecture, key flows, and gotchas live in
[`CLAUDE.local.md`](./CLAUDE.local.md). Claude Code automatically picks up both
files when working in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `./scripts/setup.sh` — initial setup (venv via `uv`, dependencies, pre-commit hooks). Re-run after pulling latest code.
- `uv run pytest` — run all tests
- `uv run pytest provider/tests/<file>.py` — run a specific test file
- `uv run ruff check provider/` — lint
- `uv run ruff format provider/` — auto-format
- `uv run mypy provider/` — type check
- `pre-commit run --all-files` — full pre-commit gate

Always run `pre-commit run --all-files` after a code change to ensure the new
code adheres to the project standards.

## Code Style

### Comments

Only use comments to explain complex, multi-line blocks of code. Do not comment
obvious operations.

### Docstring Format

Use Sphinx-style docstrings with `:param:` syntax. For simple functions, a
single-line docstring is fine.

Don't explain inner workings of the code in the docstrings (you can use inline
comments for that if/when needed). The docstring should provide clarity to the
**caller** of the function/method, not explain how it works
technically/internally.

```python
def my_function(param1: str, param2: int, param3: bool = False) -> str:
    """
    Brief one-line description of the function.

    :param param1: Description of what param1 is used for.
    :param param2: Description of what param2 is used for.
    :param param3: Description of what param3 is used for.
    """
```

Do **not** use Google-style (`Args:`) or bullet-style (`- param:`) docstrings.
AI assistants tend to generate Google-style by default — explicitly steer them
to Sphinx, and rewrite anything that slips through.

## Branching and PRs

- All work-in-progress PRs target `dev` (primary development branch).
- Before opening a PR: run lint + tests + `pre-commit run --all-files`. CI runs `ruff format --check`, so pushing without `ruff format` is the most common red build.

## Pull Request Workflow

All non-trivial changes go through a pull request — never push directly to
`dev`. Inside a PR, follow this loop:

1. **Self-review.** Run at least one self-review pass on the diff (e.g. the
   `/code-review` skill or an equivalent reviewer) before asking for human
   review.
2. **Copilot triage.** Check the PR for GitHub Copilot review comments. For
   each comment: analyze it, apply a fix when warranted, reply with a short
   justification, and resolve the thread.
3. **Version + changelog.** *After* review feedback is addressed, bump the
   `VERSION` file (PEP 440 — `1.2.0` stable, `1.2.0b1` beta) and add a
   `CHANGELOG.md` entry — in the same PR. The release pipeline tags and
   publishes automatically when the new `VERSION` lands on `dev`.
4. **Ask before merging.** Always request explicit maintainer approval to
   merge. Do not self-merge or enable auto-merge without it. (Auto-merge is
   reserved for `distribute.yml`-generated wrapper-sync PRs from
   `ma-provider-tools`.)

Follow-up commits driven by review (your own pass or Copilot's) land directly
on the PR branch — no separate PR needed.

## Upstream is Read-Only

Never push to or open PRs against the upstream Music Assistant repo
(`music-assistant/server` — the true upstream) or the integration fork
(`trudenboy/ma-server`) without an explicit maintainer instruction. The
provider repo is the source of truth; sync to the integration fork and
upstream PR submission run automatically through `ma-provider-tools`
workflows (`sync-to-fork.yml`, `upstream-pr.yml`).

## Debugging

Music Assistant stores its data in `$HOME/.musicassistant/`. When debugging
locally:

- **Logs:** `$HOME/.musicassistant/musicassistant.log` (current),
  `musicassistant.log.1`, `.log.2`, etc. for older rotated logs.
- **Database:** `$HOME/.musicassistant/library.db` — query via `sqlite3`.
  **Only execute SELECT queries** — never write to a live database.
